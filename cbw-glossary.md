## Basics 
* __Altcoin__: a catch-all term used to refer to all cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin such as: Litecoin, Monero and Zcash among many others.
* __Bear market__: a market in which cryptocurrency prices are falling and buying cryptocurrencies is encouraged. 
* __Block__: files in which transaction data is recorded on a Blockchain. Blocks are filled with  new transactions and appended to the Blockchain in chronological order. Blocks added to the blockchain are immutable in nature and cannot be removed from it.
* __Bitcoin__: referencing the Bitcoin network. Not to be confused with the actual currency which is spelled in lowercase as bitcoin.
* __Blockchain__: a constantly growing ledger which keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological and immutable way.
* __Blockchain 1.0__: referring to the first application of blockchain technology: cryptocurrencies.
* __Blockchain 2.0__: referring to smart contracts, software that runs and “lives” on the blockchain. Smart contracts allow for programming on top of a blockchain.
* __Blockchain 3.0__: referring to the introduction of DApps (Decentralized Applications) to blockchain technology. As opposed to traditional applications, DApps are decentralized in nature.
* __Block Explorer__: a tool that provides information on the contents of blocks and transaction details on a Blockchain.
* __Bull market__: a market in which cryptocurrency prices are rising, encouraging selling of cryptocurrencies.
* __Distributed Computing__: approach to computing in which components of a software system are distributed, or shared, among multiple computers. Distributed computing aims to improve efficiency and performance, as well as eliminate single point of failure.
* __Distributed Ledger Technology__: a database type that is geographically spread. Records are stored chronologically in an ever growing ledger. The data available on a distributed ledger can be either “permissioned” or “public”. 
* __Enterprise Blockchain__: refers to the use of blockchain technology within large corporations.
* __Genesis Block__: the first or first few blocks of a blockchain.
* __IPFS__: InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol designed to enable a permanent and decentralized method for storing and sharing files.
* __Miner__: a special type of node in a cryptocurrency network which processes and confirms transactions through a process that is referred to as “mining.”
* __Mining__: the process of solving cryptographic problems using computer resources in order to discover newly hashed blocks and append them to a public blockchain.
* __Open Source__: refers to any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit.
* __Peer-to-Peer (P2P)__: the direct sharing of data between nodes on a network, as opposed to via a central server.
* __Public Blockchain__: a large distributed network using a native token (such as bitcoin) that is open to everyone to participate and maintain.
* __Private Blockchain__: a closely controlled network operated by consortia in which the data is confidential and is accessed only by trusted members. Private blockchains do not require a token.
* __Pump and Dump__: fraudulent practice of encouraging investors to buy a certain asset as a way to artificially inflate the price and then selling one’s own shares at the inflated price.

## Bitcoin
* __bitcoin (lowercase)__: a cryptocurrency that came into existence in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a digital currency that doesn’t require a centralized authority to work or function.
* __Bitcoin (uppercase)__: referencing the Bitcoin network. Not to be confused with the actual currency which is spelled in lowercase as bitcoin.

This enables fast transactions between participating nodes and is thought to be a solution to the scalability problems of Bitcoin. The lightning network features bidirectional peer-to-peer payment channels for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network without delegating custody of funds.
* __Satoshi__: the smallest unit of Bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC
* __Satoshi Nakamoto__: the name used by the unknown person or group of people who developed bitcoin and authored the bitcoin white paper.

* __Cryptographic Hash Function__: hash function which takes an input and converts it into an irreversible fixed-size alphanumeric string (also referred to as hash).
* __Public Key__: cryptographic key publicly available, that is used to encrypt messages intended for a particular recipient. Only the recipient can decipher the encrypted messages using a second key, called the private key. 
* __Private Key__: cryptographic key that can decipher messages encrypted with a public key.

## Ethereum
* __DApps__: decentralized applications that operate on a Peer-to-Peer network of distributed computers rather than a single computer. 
* __Ether__: the cryptocurrency transacted through the Ethereum platform which ‘powers’ the network to perform transactions.
* __Ethereum__: a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts created by Vitalik Buterin.
* __Smart Contract__: software logic that executes automated events when data is written to the blockchain according to rules specified in the contract.
* __Solidity__: a high-level contract language used to develop smart contracts, that is similar to JavaScript.

## Exchanges
* __Custodian__: financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping, minimizing the risk of asset theft or loss.
* __DEX__: short for Decentralized Exchange and is a cryptocurrency exchange which is not operated by a central authority and thus is fully decentralized in nature.
* __Exchange__: also referred to as digital currency exchange (DCE), is an exchange on which clients can trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies or for fiat money. Such exchanges are centralized in nature and operated by a central authority.
## Future of Organizations
* __DAO__: stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and is an organization that is fully maintained on a blockchain, and is run through rules programmed as smart contracts on that blockchain.
* __DAC__: short for Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, is an organization that is fully maintained on a blockchain, and is run through rules programmed as smart contracts.
## Tokenomics
* __ICO__: Initial Coin Offering, a fundraising method which can be used to raise money for a blockchain project. By investing in a project you get tokens of that particular DApps.
* __IEO__: a newer fundraising practice where projects gets listed directly on exchanges. The developers will mint the project’s token, send it to the exchange which then will sell these tokens to their contributors in exchange for another cryptocurrency.
* __ITO__: Initial Token Offering, see ICO.
* __Security Token__: investment contract which represents legal ownership of a physical or digital asset like real estate, ETFs etc.
* __STO__: Security Token Offering, a fundraising method that, unlike an ICO, comes in the form of an investment contract into an investment asset such as bonds, stocks, funds, shares or real estate trusts.
* __Token__: a particular fungible and tradable asset or a utility in a specific project.
* __Tokenomics__: The hows and whys of implementing a token within an ecosystem such that people can use it to exchange goods and services in that ecosystem.
* __Utility Token__: a digital token of cryptocurrency that is issued in order to fund development of the cryptocurrency and that can be later used to purchase a good or service offered by the issuer of the cryptocurrency.

## Technicalities
* __51% Attack__: Situation where more than 50% of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single entity (a miner or a pool of miners.)
* __ASIC__: “Application Specific Integrated Circuit” (ASIC) chips are special type of computer chip designed to perform a specific task.
* __Consensus Algorithms__:  a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed systems.
* __Digital Signature__: Digital signature is a term used to describe the marking or signing of an electronic document through the use of a technology known as public-key cryptography.
* __Delegated Proof of Stake__: consensus algorithm that uses real-time voting combined with a social system of reputation to achieve consensus. It is considered to be the least centralized consensus mechanism compared to others.
* __Double Spending__: A form of attack in which a given set of currency is spent in more than one transaction. This is one of the key attacks that is addressed through the use of Blockchain technology and distributed consensus.
* __Cryptocurrency Faucet__: a reward system, in the form of a website or app, that rewards visitors in cryptocurrency for completing small tasks.
* __Full Node__: a device (computer, server) that contains a full copy of the transaction history of the blockchain
* __Hard fork__: a radical change to the protocol that requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.
* __Hashing__: the process of converting a string of characters into a small fixed-sized string of text that represent the original string of characters.
* __Hashrate__: the speed at which a given mining machine operates. 
* __Mainnet__: The blockchain that provides users the ability to send and receive digital currency.
* __Multisig__: Multisignature is a type of technology which requires multiple parties to digitally sign a transaction before it can be accepted and processed. This adds additional security to transactions.
* __Orphan block__: valid blocks which are not part of the main chain. They can occur naturally when two miners produce blocks at similar times or they can be caused by an attacker (with enough hashing power) attempting to reverse transactions.
* __Proof of Stake__: consensus algorithm used by some cryptocurrency blockchain networks to achieve distributed consensus and prevent double spending. Through this mechanism participants earn the right to add new blocks and earn new tokens, based on how much of that cryptocurrency they already hold.
* __Proof of Work__: consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies to achieve distributed consensus and prevent double spending. This consensus mechanism requires participants to repeatedly solve mathematical challenges in order to earn the right to append blocks to the blockchain and earn rewards for their completed work.
* __SHA-256__: a type of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and used to authenticate blocks of transaction data. SHA-256 generates a fixed size 256-bit (32-byte) hash that is almost unique. A SHA-256 Hash is a one way function which cannot be decrypted back.
* __Soft fork__: a protocol change, but with backward compatibility.
* __Testnet__: a blockchain network created especially by blockchain developers to test the changes done within it. This way the developers don’t have to spend resources to carry out the tests and also don’t have to affect the workings of the main blockchain.
* __Uncle block__: the name of an orphan block in Ethereum and Ethereum based blockchains

## Wallet types
* __Cold Wallet__: also known as cold storage, is an offline, hardware wallet on which cryptocurrencies can be stored. It is considered by far the safest way of storing cryptocurrencies.
* __Lightning Wallet__: cryptocurrency wallet that supports the use of Lightning Network to make micropayments.
* __Multicurrency Wallet__: a cryptocurrency wallet that can hold multiple types of cryptocurrencies at once.
